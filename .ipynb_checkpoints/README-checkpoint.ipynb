I used the cleaned data set that includes political, environmental, financial, and health data for the 5 countries with the highest GDP in 2018. I stripped away the country name and randomized the order of the training and testing data. I then created a generalized prediction model that can predict GDP in dollars for different countries solely based on metrics collected for the country in that given year. Furthermore, I used interpretability from my linear regression model to show the relative weight of each feature in my datset for predicting GDP in my generalized model.\n",

    "My generalized model for predicting GDP of any country based on political, environmental, financial,and health data was created using the countries with the top 5 GDP’s in 2018. To best predict GDP with a generalizable model I recommend using a random forest with extra trees model. To improve this model and create a model that can truly generalize to many country types, I recommend including data from a myriad of countries with high, middle and low GDP’s. This would also give more robust information about what metrics a country can focus on in order to increase their overal GDP. \n",

    "To best forecast future GDP for the USA I suggest predicting one year in advance at a time and including political, environmental, financial, and health data. Given that you cannot truly know political, environmental, financial, and health metrics for years in the future I suggest forecasting each of these features based on past data. Then I suggest feeding those predictions into your forecasting model for USA GDP. This next step would be somewhat intensive but I predict that it would provide better results than forecasting without exogenous variables.\n",
